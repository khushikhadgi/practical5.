Bhosale was born in the Shivneri Fort in Maharashtra on 19 February 1630 to mother Raajmata Jijabai and 

father Shri.Shahajiraje Bhosale. It is said that mother Jijabai prayed to Lord Shiva in Shivneri Fort for a brave 

son and kept her son name as Shivaji after the Hindu god Shiva.[1]

father Shri.Shahajiraje Bhosale was a prominent sardar in the Deccan. He worked under the local Deccan 

sultanates. At the time of Chh.Shivaji Maharaj's birth, most of the territory in Maharashtra was under the 

possession of the Nizamshah of Ahmednagar and the Adilshah of Bijapur who were known as the Deccan 

sultanates. In the coastal belt of Konkan, there were two sea powers fighting for control, the Christian 

Portuguese and the Muslim Siddi. The British and the Dutch who were engaged in expanding their trade 

also had their factories on the coast. The Mughals, since the period of Emperor Akbar wanted to expand 

their power in the South. The Mughals launched a campaign to conquer the Nizamshahi Kingdom. The 

Adilshah of Bijapur allied with the Mughals in this campaign. Shri. Shahajiraje Bhosale tried to rebel, but he 

could not withstand the combined might of the Mughals and the Adilshahi. The Nizamshahi kingdom came 

to an end in 1636. Thereafter Shri.Shahajiraje became a Sardar of the Adilshah of Bijapur and was posted in 

Karnataka. The region comprising Pune, Supe, Indapur, and Chakan Parganas located between the Bhima 

and Nira rivers which were vested in Shri. Shahajiraje as a jagir was continued by the Adilshah. Shri. 

Shahajiraje was also assigned a jagir of Bangalore. Raajmata Jijabai and Chh. Shivaji Maharaj, stayed for a few 

years with Shri.Shahajiraje at Bangalore until Chh. Shivaji Maharaj was twelve years old. Shri. Shahaji 

entrusted the administration of the Lakshmi jagir to Chh.Shivaji and Mata Jijabai. Chh. Shivaji grew up 

amidst the hills and valleys of the Pune region under the guidance of his mother Raajmata Jijabai. His 

mother Jijabai taught Chh. Shivaji Maharaj the stories of the Hindu epics and scriptures such as 

Mahabharata and also stories of old mighty Hindu kingdoms such as the Vijayanagara. Chh. Shivaji Maharaj 

was also trained in guerrilla warfare. He defeated the Mughal forces of Rai Bagan.
